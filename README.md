# Introduction
Hello, welcome to my GitHub account. My nickname is EmbdeddCat, I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus and the field that interested me the most is that of embedded systems. This field requires two pieces of knowledge, first, you have to know about computer architecture, and second is that you must know low-level programming. For those reasons, I'm studying computer architecture at the university and I focused mainly on low-level programming languages, such as C/C++ and Rust. Also, I found it very interesting to study the ways that embedded systems may be vulnerable and how to secure them, for example, an attack is that of a side-channel attack. That's it, that's my introduction, I hope that you will find interesting projects in this GitHub account. Contact me if there is any problem or if you want any collaboration. Have a good day/night.
